  <h1>set you wallet adress</h1>
  <p>
    Why do we need you wallet adress ? To facilitate connecting two players in
    the private message section, we need both players to provide their Solana
    wallet addresses (used in game) in our database and their player Name ( used
    in game ). This will simplify the process for both players.
